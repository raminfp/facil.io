Parses HTTP request headers. This allows review of the expected content length

Returns the number of bytes consumed before the full request was accepted.

Returns -1 on fatal error (i.e. protocol error).
Returns -2 when the request parsing didn't complete.

Incomplete request parsing updates the content in the buffer. The same buffer
and the same `http_request_s` should be returned to the parsed on the next
attempt, only the `len` argument is expected to grow.

The buffer should be kept intact for the life of the request object, as the
HTTP/1.1 parser does NOT copy any data.

The `on_header_found` allows the caller to save any header locations and data.

recycled).
