# How to Contribute

Thank you for inquiring `facil.io`'s contribution guide. It's people like you and me, that are willing to share our efforts, that help make the world of open source development so inspiring and wonderful.

"Facil" comes from the Spanish word "easy", and this is embedded in `facil.io`'s DNA.

`facil.io` contributions should (ideally) be:

* Easy to use: clear and concise API, with macros that emulate "named arguments" when appropriate).

* Easy to maintain:

    * Modular: even at the price of performance.

        Developers should be able to simply remove the module from their implementation if they're not using it.

        To clarify, a module should have as small a responsibility as possible. This makes the module easier to maintain and minimizes code fragility and code entanglement.

    * Clearly commented: you might not always have time to maintain your contribution. It's important to pave the way for others to lend a hand.

* Easy to port:

    When possible, code should be portable. This is both true in regards to CPU architecture and in regards to OS and environment.

    The project currently has the following limitation that I hope to resolve in the future:

    * The coded uses unaligned memory access (requires newer CPUs).

    * The code requires `kqueue` or `epoll` servicces from the OS, which means Linux / BSD / macOS.

    * The code assumes a Unix environment (file naming etc').

* Easy to compile:

    The code uses GNU `make` and although we have CMake support, neither CMake nor `configure` should be required at any point.

## Play nice

As a child, I wasn't any good with people (I'm not sure I'm any better now that I'm older)... which is how come I became good with computers and why we have `facil.io` and other open source projects ;-)

However, I promise to do my best to be a respectful communicator and I ask that you do your best as well.

No matter if discussing a PR (where we might find ourselves entering a heated discussion) or answering an Issue (where sometime we find ourselves wondering why people think we work for them)... we should all remember that a little compassion and respect goes a long way.

## A quick run-down

`facil.io` is comprised of the following module "families":

* The Core:

    This module family comprises `facil.io`'s core. Although it can (mostly) be used outside of `facil.io`, none of the modules in this family can be removed. This includes:

    * The IO reactor (`evio`), the event loop (`defer`), the socket abstraction layer (`sock`) and the "glue" (`facil`).

    * Core types available for all the rest of the modules: `fio_list` (a simple doubly linked list), `fio_hash_table` (a simple Hash Table), `fio_dict` (a trie structure) and `spnlock` (simple atomic operations and a spin-lock).

        I avoided `atomic.h` and a few other C11 features because they weren't available on all the platforms where I was compiling `facil.io`, which is partially why I wrote the `spnlock` and the core types.

* Services:

    The services folder refers to independent modules that might require Core integration for initialization and resource management.

    Services should *always* be optional. A good example is the Pub/Sub module that can be removed without disrupting the core...

    However, this is also a good example for what *not* to do, since the Websocket module (as of version 0.4.5) requires the Pub/Sub service. This should be fixed by adding `weak` stub versions of the `pubsub_*` functions to the Websocket module.

* HTTP / Websocket:

    Although this module family seems very entangled, I did my best to make it easy to maintain and extend with a minimum of entanglement.

    HTTP request and response modules support virtual function tables for future HTTP/2 extensions. The actual request/response implementations might vary between protocol implementation, but their interface should be version agnostic.

    The Websocket module depends on the Pub/Sub service.

    Optional modules that attach to the HTTP / Websocket layer should be placed in a subfolder (which should be listed in the makefile's `LIB_PUBLIC_SUBFOLDERS`).

* Redis:

    The redis engine is in it's own folder, both because it's clearly an "add-on" (even though it's a pub/sub add-on) and because it's as optional as it gets.

    This is also a good example for my preference for modular design. The RESP parser can be easily ported to different projects and is totally separate from the network layer.

## Where to start / Roadmap

Before you start working on a feature, I recommend that you open a PR to edit this CONTRIBUTING file.

Add the feature you want to work on to the following list (or assign an existing feature to yourself). This will allow us to discuss, in the PR's thread, any questions you might have or any expectations that might effect the API or the feature.

Once you have all the information you need to implementing the feature, the discussion can move to the actual feature's PR.

These are the features that have been requested so far. Even if any of them are assigned, feel free to offer your help:

|      Feature      |      assigned      |      remarks               |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
|   Documentation   |       help üôè      | place in the `docs` folder |
|      HTTP/2       |  Bo (help wanted)  |                            |
|    HTTP Router    |                    |                            |
|  Websocket Client |                    |                            |
|      SSL/TLS      |                    |Use `sock` R/W hooks        |


## License

The project requires that all the code is licensed under the MIT license. Please refrain from using or offering code that required a change to the licensing scheme.

I have no idea what Github's terms of service dictate in regards to PRs, but I'm sure it's reasonable and that it should apply.
